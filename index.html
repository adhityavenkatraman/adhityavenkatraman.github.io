            I'm a Research Fellow at Stanford GSB. I study information economics with Professors Becky Lester and John Kepler. Previously, I earned attended Claremont McKenna College, gradutating with a dual major in Data Science & Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. Outside the classroom, my interests have led me to diverse experiences, from economics research to software engineering to volunteering in prisons.

                    At CMC, I studied <a class="link" href="https://www.cmcppe.org/" target="_blank">Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) </a> and Data Science. The PPE program draws on the Oxford method of instruction, enabling students to interact one-on-one with professors in tutorial-style debates. Data Science complements these conversations, allowing me to test and further investigate the abstract ideas discusssed in PPE.

                    I have also developed a robust programming toolkit through two data science and software engineering internships at Cisco Systems. I was focused on building data pipelines, transforming data, and analyzing it en masse as part of the <a class="link" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/dna-center/index.html" target="_blank">Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center Team</a>. In my first internship, I was focused on developing an automated tool to test APIs for performance and scale. I additionally produced a reporting mechanism to track metrics, allowing engineers to improve microservices in an informed, effective way. The following summer, as part of the DNA Center Telemetry team, I developed an algorithm to identify potential process bottlenecks before they occur. With use cases for customers and internal teams, my project not only identified slowdowns, but also visualized them, allowing teams to easily understand where their workflows were being stuck. This tool is now patent-pending.

                    At Stanford GSB, I work with Becky Lester and John Kepler to study a variety of issues, including international tax evasion, compensation, and local subsidy programs. I've previously worked as a research assistant for Professors Jeffrey Flory, Cameron Shelton, Angela Vossmeyer, and Florian Madison on a variety of topics, including diversity in hiring, political bias in syllabi, funding allocated to districts during vacancies, banking failures, and the relationship between democracy and dollarization. I frequently use statistics, machine learning and sciripting in this research. I have developed fluency with several tools, including Python, Stata, R, SQL, Tableau, Tensorflow, and MATLAB.

                <p>
                    Finally, I wrote my senior honors thesis on the effect individual representatives have on the federal funds allocated to their own district. This project builds on research conducted this past summer with Professor Cameron Shelton. Drawing on Shigeo Hiranoâ€™s 2011 article on the Japanese Diet, I am exploring these effects in the context of the United States. Thus far, the project has involved collecting, cleaning, and transforming massive datasets about federal spending at the district level. I use Congressional vacancies as an exogenous shock to isolate changes in funding when representatives cannot advocate for their districts. My hypothesis, supported by the literature and initial analysis, suggests that spending declines when representatives are absent from the legislative body but increases in nearby districts. The project is currently being prepared for publication.

                    On campus, I've dedicated my time to research in economics and empirical political science. I manage the Rose Institute of State and Local Government, setting a research agenda and managing a student staff of more than 30 students working on demographics, survey research, and local economic forecasting. At the Rose, I've written on <a class="link" href="http://s10294.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IE-Housing-Market-Snapshot.pdf" target="_blank">the housing market</a>, <a class="link" href="materials/True_Time_Served_Final.pdf" target="_blank">criminal justice</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://s10294.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Winners-and-Losers_2020-Census.pdf" target="_blank">redistricting</a>.

                   My <a class="link" href="https://github.com/adhityavenkatraman/" target="_blank">Github</a> features a few of my recent projects, including an implementation of <a class="link" href="https://github.com/adhityavenkatraman/PageRank" target="_blank">Google's foundational Pagerank algorithm</a>, an <a class="link" href="https://github.com/adhityavenkatraman/Performance-and-Scale-Testing" target="_blank">automated API performance and scale testing tool</a>, and a pair of projects that leverage data science to explore political ideology in media and campaign finance. The first of these examines political bias in social media using natural language processing. I published an article in Toward Data Science, which you can read <a class="link" href="https://avenkatraman22.medium.com/headline-and-twitter-data-based-sentiment-and-topic-analysis-c539f188fe5b" target="_blank">here</a>! We looked at over 140,000 Congressional tweets to understand how officials disseminate information in the era of fake news. Here's one of my favorite graphics from the project that captures the difference in reporting between Brietbart and the New York Times. Click the image below to see the full-size version!

                    In the second project, I examine data on the flow of donations in presidential elections from 1980-2016 in relation to the ideology of donors and recipients. You can read the report in either <a class="link" href="materials/Ideology and Campaign Finance.html" target="_blank">html</a> or <a class="link" href="materials/Ideology and Campaign Finance.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>, while the repository with all the code and figures is <a class="link" href="https://github.com/adhityavenkatraman/Ideology-and-Campaign-Finance" target="_blank">here</a>. I make a number of interesting findings. First, the most prolific donors seem to have more extreme viewpoints and ideologies. Second, there seems to be a negative relationship between the size of contributions and the number of contributions made. This relationship seems to decrease logarithmically. Finally, I find that elite, powerful donors donate more than non-elites on average. I also find that the distribution of political ideology may be less extreme among elites than it is in the general population. I conclude by summarizing my findings, acknowledging major limitations, and offering recommendations for future work. One of my favorite graphics from this project visaulizes the ideologies of elites from various companies against the size of their donations. The companies in the below graphic are ordered by their ideology, with red indicating conservative and blue indicating liberal ideologies. Click the image below to see the full-size version!
