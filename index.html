                    At CMC, I study <a class="link" href="https://www.cmcppe.org/" target="_blank">Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) </a> and Data Science. The PPE program draws on the Oxford method of instruction, enabling students to interact one-on-one with professors in tutorial-style debates. Data Science complements these conversations, allowing me to test and further investigate the abstract ideas discusssed in PPE.

                <p>
                    I've worked as a research assistant for several professors. Using data from a randomized control trial conducted at one of the world’s largest financial services firms, I worked with Professor Jeffrey Flory to identify the effectiveness of various diversity-focused recruiting messages. In addition to cleaning and preparing the dataset, I introduced a new aspect into the project that leverages natural language processing to determine the linguistic characteristics of a successful treatment. Using decision trees, I produced probabilities of each treatment’s likelihood of being objective or subjective and positive or negative. These values were then added to the model, allowing for an analysis of the meta-characteristics that correlate to a successful treatment. I have also worked with Professor Florian Madison on the relationship between dollarization and democracy, helping to provide the empirical support for a theoretical understanding of this dynamic. Additionally, I am working with Professor Angela Vossmeyer on a project focused on the transfer of risk and path-dependent failures among regional banks during the Great Depression. This project included finding the spatial relationship between bank failures by geocoding each bank based on archival data. 
                    Finally, I am writing my senior honors thesis on the effect individual representatives have on the federal funds allocated to their own district. This project builds on research conducted this past summer with Professor Cameron Shelton. Drawing on Shigeo Hirano’s 2011 article on the Japanese Diet, I am exploring these effects in the context of the United States. Thus far, the project has involved collecting, cleaning, and transforming massive datasets about federal spending at the district level. I use Congressional vacancies as an exogenous shock to isolate changes in funding when representatives cannot advocate for their districts. My hypothesis, supported by the literature and initial analysis, suggests that spending declines when representatives are absent from the legislative body but increases in nearby districts.

                    On campus, I've dedicated my time to research in economics and empirical political science. I manage the Rose Institute of State and Local Government, setting a research agenda and managing a student staff of more than 30 students working on demographics, survey research, and local economic forecasting. At the Rose, I've written on <a class="link" href="http://s10294.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IE-Housing-Market-Snapshot.pdf" target="_blank">the housing market</a>, <a class="link" href="materials/True_Time_Served_Final.pdf" target="_blank">criminal justice</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://s10294.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Winners-and-Losers_2020-Census.pdf" target="_blank">redistricting</a>.g

                   My <a class="link" href="https://github.com/adhityavenkatraman/" target="_blank">Github</a> features a few of my recent projects, including an implementation of Google's foundational Pagerank algorithm, an automated API performance and scale testing tool, and a pair of projects that leverage data science to explore political ideology in media and campaign finance. The first of these examines political bias in social media using natural language processing, click <a class="link" href="https://avenkatraman22.medium.com/headline-and-twitter-data-based-sentiment-and-topic-analysis-c539f188fe5b" target="_blank">here</a>! We looked at over 140,000 Congressional tweets to understand how officials disseminate information in the era of fake news. Here's one of my favorite graphics from the project that captures the difference in reporting between Brietbart and the New York Times.

                In another project, I examine data on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/adhityavenkatraman/Ideology-and-Campaign-Finance" target="_blank">the flow of donations in presidential elections from 1980-2016 in relation to the ideology of donors and recipients</a>. I make a number of interesting findings. First, the most prolific donors seem to have more extreme viewpoints and ideologies. Second, there seems to be a negative relationship between the size of contributions and the number of contributions made. This relationship seems to decrease logarithmically. Finally, I find that elite, powerful donors donate more than non-elites on average. I also find that the distribution of political ideology may be less extreme among elites than it is in the general population. I conclude by summarizing my findings, acknowledging major limitations, and offering recommendations for future work.
