    <p>My name is Adhitya and I am a junior at <a class="link" href="https://www.cmc.edu/">Claremont McKenna College</a> from San Jose, California. I'm studying Data Science and <a class="link" href="https://www.cmcppe.org/">Philosophy, Politics, and Economics</a>. This past summer, I worked as a software engineering intern at <a class="link" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/cisco-on-cisco/dnac-network-as-a-platform.html">Cisco's Digital Network Architecture</a> platform. My <a class="link" href="https://github.com/adhityavenkatraman/adhityavenkatraman/">Github</a> features a few of my recent projects.</p>
    <p>Using problem solving as a tool to understand and improve outcomes for society, business, and the disenfranchised excites me. After spending time as a researcher at <a class="link" href="https://www.ibj.org/">International Bridges to Justice</a>, a nonprofit that aims to end torture in prisons, I discovered my passion for combining analytical methods, whether qualitative and quantitative, to make a difference. </p>
    <p>On campus, I've spent my time in SOURCE Nonprofit Consuting, the Rose Institute of State and Local Government, and as a research assistant for several professors. You can check out some of my research <a class="link" href="http://s10294.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IE-Housing-Market-Snapshot.pdf">here</a>. More information is available on my <a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adhityavenkatraman/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>I love entertaining my friends with stand-up, tea, and baked goods.</p>
